    "text": " Hello everyone and welcome to the first ever episode of Laila. I"m your host Antonio Prattis and let me start by thanking you so much for just giving us a go and having a listen because if you"re made it this far it"s already a great win for me. Again welcome this will be episode zero and just so you know this will be a bit different than what we"ll be doing for the other episodes to come. Episode zero will be an intro about the podcast I"ll talk about what this is and I"m talking about what my ideas are for the future and I"ll also try to introduce myself a bit so you know who I am so you have an idea of why I"m doing it. So let"s start with what is the podcast about? So layer is a design podcast that will be focusing on designers rather than just design. I want to talk about a bit of everything really but I want to really focus on interesting designers with interesting stories. I want to focus on pretty much everything from product design to graphic, motion, digital, industrial. There"s a lot of different industries and I think that there are a lot of good conversations to be had around all of these different areas. I want to talk about a lot of different subjects as well. I want to talk about getting your first job. I want to talk about recruiters. I want to talk about freelance versus permanent. Pitch work and spec work. I want to talk about money. I want to talk about sexism in the industry for motor work, working advertising or client side. There"s a lot of different things that we can address and I"m really excited to have that that breadth of ideas and subjects that we can talk in the future. So what will be the format of this? Again, since I am a designer and I"ve worked with startups in the past in agile and with MPPs, I kind of see this as like a work in progress and I"m definitely hoping that as time goes by as I try something, I will get some feedback from you, the listener. So let me know what works, what doesn"t. Please do go ahead. Let me know what do you think works for you? What are you enjoying? What are you not enjoying? And feel free to suggest as well people. Right now I have a couple of people lined up to have on the podcast. Please do reach out if you have any suggestions or if you yourself want to be on the podcast and you have a nice interesting subject to talk about about design. Again, it can be on any type of industry as long as you are a designer. That"s my, that"s what I"m limiting myself to at the moment. Being about every everything has to be around the design industry, but it"s very, very, very broad. So the format in itself is going to be, it"s going to be twofolds. There will be two types of episodes. Most of the episodes will be with a guest, so we"ll be a conversation with a certain person. I will try to understand and get to know that person, ask them about their past, about their career. For the people that I have in mind so far, I"ve been mostly focusing on designer founders, people that have their own companies, that they started their own agencies or design studios. Because they have a really interesting experience apart from the design, which is a business side of it. And how both of those connect. It also shows that these people have, yeah, I have more interest just than the design front. They want to build something else than just a design work. So those make a really, for a really interesting conversation. The second aspect of it will be just having a topic for episode where I will have a subject to discuss one of the few that I just mentioned. And I will have someone either one person to people, a group to kind of discuss around this and share our ideas about it. I think that can be really interesting too. This podcast will be available on all the podcast platforms such as Spotify, Google podcasts, anchor, etc. But there will also be a video component on YouTube. Hello to everyone who"s watching the video. I prefer to do both of them because I think a podcast is a much better medium, but I appreciate that people are more visual than want to see the video. One thing that I"ll be trying to do as well is when interviewing someone, I will always try to be in their studio. So I"ll try to go to them rather than the other way around because you can see a bit of the studio, you can see the person and where they work. So and what is the motivation that I have for this podcast? Essentially it is a bit of a selfish motivation if I"m very, very honest. My main motivation is to have interesting conversations with designers. I really love having good conversations with people and lately I just realized that on the daily basis with all the work and things going on, I don"t have that time. So this will be a slot that I"ll be locating to discuss something and having an interesting conversation with someone. So it is selfish because I"m doing this for myself in a way and also because I want to meet these people that are interesting and I want to understand them and learn about them a bit. But hopefully you will subscribe to that idea and also appreciate the conversations. In the past I"ve wrote a couple of articles about design and while I think that writing is a really nice wave expression, I do think that voice is a lot more authentic. For the last year or so I"ve been really addicted to podcasts, listening to podcasts from a tech to design to climbing to sometimes even comedy. And it gives me a human connection that I much rather have than playing a candy crush for instance while commuting. So I really love this format and this medium. So I"m really trying to explore it a bit more and see what I can do with it and how people react to it as well. The motivation is also to have that place, to have that conversation and to be able to discuss subjects that I"m passionate about or that are present in my life on a daily basis and all of us as designers, conversations about the industry, about the differences between freelance and firm, there"s something that comes almost on a daily basis. So yeah, or any really random topic related to design that is relevant. So apart from that and just I think you"d be interested in knowing who"s running this thing. I"d like to talk a bit about myself so as I said before my name is Antonio and I"m Bayzen London and I"m a digital designer. I"m originally from Portugal, I"ve been living in London for the last six years. I"ve been working as a designer for the last 13 years give or take and for the last 40 years I"ve been a freelancer. I worked a bit across everywhere, all these focus in digital. I"ve done work at the advertising agencies like Avas and McKenna London and AMD video. I"ve also done some work with smaller studios like Perracratic and also worked with Winhouse, Hinaus and Client sides with first-city economist intelligence unit, Virgin Media and most recently Farfetch. For the last couple of years I"ve been mostly focused on product design but digital design from web to mobile apps has always been kind of like my focus. I"ve done a couple other things also to co-founder the small design studio while I was at uni and I co-founder the startup back in Portugal. I"ve written a book on thought design and again as I said a couple of articles on design online. I"ve also been mentoring some students on the UI design and product design and most recently in career coaching helping students that just finished a non-line course on design to find their first job which is something I really really like to do. And in this podcast is essentially the latest project and experiment in design to kind of fuel the passion that I have for the industry to kind of explore that a bit more. So that is it for this episode that this is a really short one just wanted to kind of intro myself and intro the podcast as well. I promised the next one would be a bit better also a bit longer. I"m aiming to have episodes from 45 minutes to an hour sometimes a bit longer if the conversation is good. I really don"t want to I don"t want to limit the conversation if it"s just flowing really well because I think that this is going to be interesting content and I just want to get the most out of the people that I"ll be chatting with. Please do leave us a comment either on YouTube or a DM on Twitter. We"re at layer podcasts or send us an email to helloatlayerpodcast.com. Any suggestions ideas, suggestions for people or just hate mail as well that"s appreciated. Anything just reach out and I"ll see you at the next one. Thank you very much for listening.", "segments": [{
