Here. Hello

1
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.600
 everyone. Welcome to

2
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.400
 the second lesson of motion tricks today. We will

3
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.200
 learn how to create 3D shapes in After Effects

4
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.300
 and how to stilize them to match our

5
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.300
 desired style the most important principle that we

6
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.900
 will follow when creating a design in this course is solid drawing.

7
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.100
 It is an animation technique used to create

8
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.300
 delusion of three-dimensional objects.

9
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.300
In classical animation correct perspective drawing was

10
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.200
 used to achieve a realistic 3D look as well

11
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.300
 as the light and Shadow interaction with objects as you will

12
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.400
 see modern softwares fulfill some of these tasks.

13
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.500
After Effects provides a 3D space so

14
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.300
 we can transform any layer into a 3D object.

15
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.400
The key difference between 3D and 2D layers is

16
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.000
 that in some basic parameters a new z-axis

17
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.700
 is added which represents the Third depth

18
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.400
 value. This is really useful. But at

19
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.500
 the same time creating 3D objects in After Effects is a complex

20
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.200
 topic with many nuances and limitations first.

21
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.600
 Let's make sure that our three settings are

22
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.100
 all the same since the 2022 version

23
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.500
 of After Effects. The interface has changed

24
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.900
 slightly, but there have been no fundamental differences if

25
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.300
 you create any layer and turn on

26
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.500
 the 3D mode for it, you will see several 3D and

27
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.100
 camera settings in the lower right corner of the

28
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.100
 viewport window. There are two engines available for rendering

29
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.700
 3D classic 3D is fully processed

30
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.400
 within After Effects and is the fastest

31
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.700
 option.

32
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.800
The second one Cinema 4D uses surrendering

33
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.700
 engine from the cinema for this software.

34
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.100
When you install After Effects, this is also automatically installed

35
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.100
 with the software.

36
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.300
Using it we can get a more realistic design and some

37
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.600
 additional features, but it's significantly affects the

38
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.000
 performance and some limitations May emerge.

39
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.800
Another place where we can switch between these modes and read some

40
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.100
 additional information is the composition settings.

41
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.700
You can open it from the menu by right clicking

42
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.900
 on the composition name.

43
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.600
Or from the menu composition composition settings.

44
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.500
Here we find the 3D renderer tab for Cinema

45
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.500
 4D renderer. You will see a list of all the

46
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.200
 enabled features as well as those that are

47
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.700
 disabled.

48
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.400
However, in our course we will always use the

49
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.400
 classic 3D as you can see in Cinema 4D we

50
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.500
 lose the ability to work with the blending modes

51
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.700
 track mods and layer styles.

52
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.200
Which are key styling tools for us?

53
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.400
Although there are some ways to bypass this limitations. We

54
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.300
 won't see any differences between these two

55
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.400
 modes. And since we will achieve our desired visual

56
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.100
 style using various effects. We will choose the most

57
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.400
 performant mode classic 3D make sure you have

58
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.400
 it selected here. Otherwise, you may encounter errors

59
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.400
 along the way now, let's start by creating a sphere.

60
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.300
It's interesting. That although we have a 3D space

61
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.400
 and can create 3D planes of any shape.

62
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.000
 It's technically very difficult to create a realistic smooth

63
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.700
 sphere. This is because after effects doesn't

64
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.100
 feature any built-in 3D shape presets like

65
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.300
 this for normal shaped layers, we could

66
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.500
 create 100 rectangular layer and position

67
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.200
 them in a way that it will shape a sphere

68
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.600
 but this is of course really convenient and will

69
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.200
 be very required additional scripts therefore to

70
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.200
 create a sphere. We'll use other tricks.

71
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.300
Here we have already created a composition with the

72
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.600
 same parameters as in the previous lesson. One of the fastest way

73
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.800
 to create a sphere is to use the special CC sphere

74
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.000
 effect.

75
00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.900
For this we need to create a large layer.

76
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.400
The size of entire composition we can

77
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.000
 also drag and drop one of our gradients here.

78
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.200
For example, we can use one that we

79
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.700
 have created in the previous lesson.

80
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.700
After that, and the CC sphere effect, you will

81
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.300
 see a very similar result to what we achieved in

82
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.200
 the previous lesson back. Then we were trying

83
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.400
 to simulate it manually by adjusting all the parameters, but now

84
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.200
 it's a real 3D shape with its own

85
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.800
 light source.

86
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.500
The gradient image is stretched over the entire surface

87
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.100
 of the sphere with Light Shadows and reflection added.

88
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.300
Let's take a closer. Look at the parameters. It's important

89
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.500
 to understand the physics of light and materials

90
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.500
 of why light and Shadow are positioned in

91
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.600
 such way that gives depth to the object. This

92
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.400
 will help you understand how to achieve the desired result

93
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.600
 and improve it in the beginning. You'll find the basic

94
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.400
 parameters where we can control the rotation of the sphere

95
00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.900
 radius and position in the composition.

96
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.800
Visually the light source will remain in place only during

97
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.300
 rotation.

98
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.400
This is a kind of infinity light like the sun for instance.

99
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.600
The light always falls on the object at

100
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.000
 the same angle Distributing light and Shadow regardless the

101
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.300
 size of the object. Let's animate a full rotation

102
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.800
 around the y axis approximately of

103
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.000
 one second during the course. We will stick to

104
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.400
 the principles of Animation as much as possible to ensure that the

105
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.300
 animation is more realistic and expressive. So let's

106
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.400
 start using them here already. Even if it's such

107
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.500
 a simple animation first, we create a basic linear

108
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.400
 movement, then we can add the preparation for the movement

109
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.000
 to do this at around frame five or

110
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.300
 six slightly rotate the sphere in

111
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.000
 the opposite direction.

112
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.300
Like this then for smoothness. We will change

113
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.600
 the first two keys to easy.

114
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.700
Let's look at the speed graph in this course, we will use both graphs

115
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.200
 and we will also examine their difference in the

116
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.300
 next lesson, but for now I will just use the

117
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.000
 speed graph.

118
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.500
As you can see we added some smoothness to the

119
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:17.600
 Keys.

120
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.600
Let's make the stop less approved and follow the principle of

121
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.100
 follow through.

122
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.500
The sphere will continue rotating even after

123
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.100
 it stops.

124
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.900
Let's add more movement using expressions.

125
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.800
Select the property and emotion to sprout click this elastic

126
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.600
 animation button.

127
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.800
An expression will be added to the property and the effect with

128
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.300
 its settings will be added to the effects control panel.

129
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:50.900
That's enough for now.

130
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.500
This way we see how the light

131
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.300
 works with all the colorful sides of the sphere

132
00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.500
 and we will need to manually adjust this parameter again. Let's

133
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.700
 go back to the CC sphere effect. Another important parameter

134
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.300
 for us is render. It controls what

135
00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.600
 is displayed in the sphere the outside the inside

136
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.200
 or both at the same time? We will

137
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.400
 see the difference when we create a semi sphere. You can control

138
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.300
 the light source in the Light Group here. You can

139
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.500
 see a very clearly the parameters for the intensity of

140
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.900
 the light. It's color and angle light Direction

141
00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.500
 controls the angle relative to the composition

142
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.800
 plane while light hate controls

143
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.800
 the angle relative to the viewer, for example,

144
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.500
 a 100 value position the light source

145
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.300
 exactly in front of us while minus 100

146
00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.500
 position it on the opposite side behind the sphere.

147
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.300
 Let's place this side we did in the first lesson so

148
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.200
 that the source is on the top right corner.

149
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.600
with a slight tilt

150
00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.600
Now we need to adjust the material and how

151
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.300
 the light reflects of the object.

152
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.300
This effect uses a very simplified system

153
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:05.500
 of materials and the parameters work together to affect

154
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.500
 how the material looks I can say. The ambient

155
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.100
 is the original color of the layer.

156
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.600
without any additional light or shadow

157
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.400
the fuse refers to the strength of Shadow and light on

158
00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.500
 the object depending on the light source specular is

159
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.100
 simply the highlights of the light source.

160
00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:27.000
For example to preserve the original color ambient should

161
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.500
 be set to 100 and diffuse and

162
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:30.700
 specular to zero.

163
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.100
Since the visual style, we are creating relies on

164
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:39.200
 color as the most important thing we can start with

165
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.400
 this parameters. After that. We can increase the light and

166
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.400
 Shadow and proportionally decrease ambient in time.

167
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.300
 You will learn how to find the right balance between all

168
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.200
 these parameters. The next parameter reflective is

169
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.800
 quite interesting. It adds the reflection of the environment to

170
00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.400
 the surface of the object and any other

171
00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:00.100
 layer can be used as the environment in this parameter.

172
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.300
like another gradient for example

173
00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:08.600
The result will be similar to overlaying multiple gradients

174
00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.200
 with different blending modes.

175
00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:15.500
But the best option is to have a map with a seamless texture.

176
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:20.200
So that there are no unnecessary lines on the surface the

177
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.600
 roughness and metal parameters control the

178
00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.900
 smoothness of the surface. It can look more metallic

179
00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:29.000
 or have a more plastic feel and so on they depend

180
00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.700
 on other parameters in this group and affect

181
00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.600
 how glare simplert and how other colors

182
00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.300
 on the environment are reflected.

183
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.200
Basically, this is a more realistic lighting model

184
00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.300
 similar to what we tried to manually recreate in the

185
00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:45.100
 previous lesson.

186
00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.700
And one of the main advantage of working in After

187
00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:51.400
 Effects is that we can combine all

188
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:51.900
 techniques.

189
00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.900
If you don't like the glare you can turn it off.

190
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.000
Draw it as a separate layer and blur it.

191
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.900
Overlaying two layers will work in the usual way.

192
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.400
We can also add style effects. For example

193
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.000
 inner Shadow just like we did in the first

194
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:23.500
 lesson and an additional shadow that is a little

195
00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:24.300
 easier to control.

196
00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.200
Still this layer will remain a regular layer.

197
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.200
Sometimes layer.

198
00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.700
Sometimes layer Styles and effects can conflict with each other, but

199
00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.000
 every case should be considered individually.

200
00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.600
Next let's smooth out this border.

201
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:47.400
One of the best ways to do this is to create a seamless texture,

202
00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:50.300
 but we can make it easier and try to blur this

203
00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.100
 gradient with a fast box Fuller effect.

204
00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.400
This will affect the edges of the sphere. So we need to use a

205
00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:56.600
 mask.

206
00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.700
The same layer can become the mask.

207
00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.400
Let's duplicate it remove all the unnecessary elements.

208
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.300
 I use the trackmat. We will adjust a

209
00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.200
 bit the size of the layers to make everything fit together.

210
00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.200
The main drawback of creating a sphere like

211
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.600
 this is that it is not really a 3D

212
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.100
 layer but a generated object using an effect

213
00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:30.700
 so we cannot pass other object through it or for

214
00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.400
 example link anything to its edges

215
00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.400
 After Effects developers are beginning to address this issue.

216
00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.400
 And in your version, there is the possibility to

217
00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.100
 import 3D objects without additional plugins.

218
00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.600
But at the time of recording this lesson, this features was

219
00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.100
 only available in the after effects better version.

220
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:56.600
This works with identify with the obj extension placing

221
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.200
 it in. The composition will make it

222
00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.900
 a real 3D object. It is used with the new Mercury

223
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.800
 renderer and it can be linked to rotated and

224
00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.900
 scaled like a regular layer.

225
00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:10.900
And the light is reflected from Individual layer sources,

226
00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:13.200
 but as with the cinema for the

227
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.400
 renderer layer Styles masks and blending modes

228
00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.000
 cannot be used yet.

229
00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.600
This is a cool new feature, but it is unlikely to change anything

230
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.300
 for our style effects. Give us more

231
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:31.600
 flexibility and possibilities. For example, a sphere

232
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.100
 can easily be turned into a semi sphere using the

233
00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.200
 CC sphere effect.

234
00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:40.400
The shape of a semi-sphere depends

235
00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:43.500
 on the layer map on which the effect is applied. Let's

236
00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.900
 copy the layer without blur to a new composition.

237
00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:55.300
To preserve the original gradient duplicate the composition with

238
00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.000
 gradients in the project panel.

239
00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:03.800
You can quickly find the composition using reveal reveal

240
00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.800
 layer Source in Project.

241
00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:09.300
And replace the gradient with a new one by holding

242
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:10.400
 the ALT key pressed.

243
00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:14.500
For convenience open the gradient composition in

244
00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.200
 a separate window to do this right click

245
00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.500
 on an empty space in the layer panel.

246
00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:21.200
choose new

247
00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:22.500
viewer

248
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.100
the current composition will be fixed to the window

249
00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:29.300
 on the right which is controlled by this lock to the

250
00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:30.900
 left of the composition name.

251
00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:35.400
If you open the composition with the gradient, it will expand in another

252
00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:38.300
 window. Now when the layer with the gradient

253
00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:41.400
 is moved beyond the composition the sphere starts to

254
00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.600
 change its shape the area of the sphere that corresponds

255
00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.400
 to our composition become transparent.

256
00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.200
In my case the crop is inverted because the sphere is

257
00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.300
 rotated 180 degrees.

258
00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.900
I can easily fix this make sure that the rotation X

259
00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:57.900
 is at 0.

260
00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:02.700
Yes, that's better. If you don't see a transparent area

261
00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.600
 you can switch with this button in the viewport window.

262
00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:13.400
If we start rotating the sphere you will see that it really

263
00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.800
 becomes a semi sphere and we see what is inside.

264
00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.400
Instead of blurring the gradient border. Let's cut

265
00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.700
 the sphere along this line.

266
00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.600
To do this in our case. The layer should be moved horizontally

267
00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:27.600
 and occupy just half of the composition in the

268
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.600
 position property simply set 0 in the first parameter.

269
00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:36.500
Rotate the layer on the z-axis by

270
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:37.900
 minus 90 degrees.

271
00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:41.200
And remove the animation from the y-axis.

272
00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.600
Remove the keys by clicking on the stopwatch

273
00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.400
 button, then remove the expression by

274
00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:51.200
 clicking on it again with the ALT key pressed.

275
00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:54.300
And remove this effect as we don't need it.

276
00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:57.100
 Let's finish with its appearance. We can go back

277
00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:00.600
 to the render property in the CC sphere effect. Now if

278
00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.300
 we switch the final render, we can actually see the

279
00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:06.300
 difference and see the inner part outer part or

280
00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.700
 both together. It's impossible to repaint something

281
00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:12.600
 separately because it's just one layer and

282
00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:15.400
 this is the main disadvantage of using this effect to

283
00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:16.000
 create shapes.

284
00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.400
But we can simply duplicate the layer and switch what

285
00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:21.900
 will be displayed in each of them?

286
00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:29.500
This will also help to place objects inside

287
00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:32.200
 the sphere just by placing it in between the

288
00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.500
 two layers. Let's repaint the inner part of the sphere.

289
00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.000
 It can be a gradient or just one color.

290
00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:40.800
Let's add the fill effect.

291
00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.500
Change the color to something dark in contrast

292
00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:50.200
 with the lighter outside. Okay, we can

293
00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:53.400
 also add additional depth to the outer part

294
00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:56.500
 using layer Styles. Let's add additional

295
00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.000
 light within our shadow.

296
00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:03.700
Will make it white.

297
00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:08.100
Change the blending mode to Overlay then increase

298
00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:09.700
 the distance and blur it.

299
00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.600
In general, we just need to find the right angle and balance the

300
00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:18.000
 parameters. We'll blur it enough. So that this distinct

301
00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:20.300
 boundary disappears. We can also

302
00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:23.900
 reduce the transparency property to we can the effect the overlay

303
00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:27.100
 blending mode will preserve good saturated Shades

304
00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:29.600
 if the color is dark enough, there are

305
00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.300
 pixel may appear around the semi sphere. You can fix

306
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:35.000
 this by reducing the sphere by a couple of pixels.

307
00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:40.200
The last thing we need to fix is the inconvenience of

308
00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.200
 controlling the effect on two layers. It's very

309
00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:46.200
 impractical to expand the sphere into layers every time

310
00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.700
 and duplicating Keys is not the best idea to solve

311
00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:51.900
 this. We will use linking expressions.

312
00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:57.400
Right. Now I only need rotation on the x-axis. Let's

313
00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:59.500
 link this property on the two

314
00:16:59.500 --> 00:16:59.800
 layers.

315
00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.700
Expand the effects as we need access to

316
00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:06.800
 the linking tool, which is located to the right this

317
00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.400
 button here with a spiral icon in the

318
00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.400
 parent and Link column. It is important which layer

319
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.400
 will be the main one. So let's use the one on

320
00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.400
 top click the button on the rotation property and

321
00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.100
 then drag it to the same parameter from which we need

322
00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:22.000
 to get the value.

323
00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.500
Like this, it looks great.

324
00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:27.600
Now everything works as one layer.

325
00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.400
It's always a good idea to link properties that you will

326
00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.400
 definitely use. But if you need to fully link the

327
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.400
 entire effect, it's best to use the function from

328
00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.900
 the menu edit copy it with property links.

329
00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:43.200
 There are two of them. The first one is used

330
00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.500
 to link properties between different compositions.

331
00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.300
And the second one copy with relative property links,

332
00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:52.800
 we'll link properties only within one composition

333
00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.600
 to do this select the property choose the

334
00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.400
 desired copy mode and simply paste it onto

335
00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:59.100
 another layer.

336
00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:03.100
You'll see that all the property values are

337
00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:06.200
 now in red which means that there is an

338
00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:09.300
 expression indicating the path to another property and remember that

339
00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:12.100
 it's better to link properties within a layer if they

340
00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:15.300
 are shapes and in effects and styles if

341
00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:18.200
 it's any layer most of the properties in the

342
00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:21.200
 transform group will be automatically linked if we

343
00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.400
 just link the entire layer with another one it will move

344
00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.500
 rotate and scale only the opacity property

345
00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.300
 won't work, but it can be linked with the expression if

346
00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:30.800
 you need it.

347
00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.700
And now let's add the very simple jump animation

348
00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:40.600
 in the first layer set the

349
00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:43.900
 keys on the position and rotation on the x-axis in

350
00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:46.200
 the CC sphere effect. Let's start with

351
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:49.800
 a simple outline and make it more Dynamic after time

352
00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.600
 frames. We will move the layer up.

353
00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.400
After another 10 frames, we will bring it back down

354
00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.200
 by simply copying the keyframe.

355
00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:05.600
Rotate it 360 degrees in

356
00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:08.200
 direction towards us in the last

357
00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.400
 keyframe set it to minus one. Let's prepare

358
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:11.900
 for the movement.

359
00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.400
After around three frames rotate the sphere in the opposite

360
00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:20.800
 direction.

361
00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.600
And move the layer up a bit.

362
00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:27.500
Remember that you are working at 15 frames per

363
00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:31.100
 second. If you work at 25 or 30 frames, the

364
00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:33.500
 distance between keyframes will be slightly larger,

365
00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:36.600
 but visually the proportion between frames should remain

366
00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:36.900
 the same.

367
00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:40.400
And finally We'll add a follow through.

368
00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:44.100
About three frames before the end. I can

369
00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:47.900
 duplicate the keyframes and move the layer a bit in the position property

370
00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:50.000
 as for rotation. I want to have a

371
00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:53.900
 longer animation. So let's add an elastic animation just like at the

372
00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:56.500
 beginning we can simply delete the last keyframe.

373
00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.200
Now let's work on using.

374
00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.700
Let's add some Easy's on the first fourth

375
00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:10.500
 keyframes. The quickest way to do. This is by pressing

376
00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:13.500
 F9 at the beginning. We need a smoother

377
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:17.000
 animation, but the full should be more quick but

378
00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:19.700
 the fall should be quicker returning to

379
00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:21.900
 the starting position. Can then be smooth again?

380
00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:29.100
For the animation to be realistic. We need the semisphere triangle

381
00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:31.900
 little in the uppermost position until gravity

382
00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:32.400
 comes in.

383
00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.900
And bring it back down. We could just start some easies

384
00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:39.300
 on this. Keyframe, but that won't be

385
00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:39.500
 enough.

386
00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:43.300
Let's open the speed graph to make it hang in a

387
00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:46.200
 place for longer. We need to move the handles further to

388
00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:46.700
 the sides.

389
00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:50.800
Make the animation sharper at the beginning by increasing this

390
00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.600
 graph and smoother in the middle.

391
00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:00.500
It's easier to do this in motion tools with days

392
00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:01.300
 in control widget.

393
00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:05.700
Which is the third slider it will simultaneously control

394
00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:08.100
 the incoming and outgoing handles.

395
00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.800
Let's slow down the rotation a bit on the

396
00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:15.100
 peak and let's add the keyframe in the middle.

397
00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:19.200
We'll turn the semi sphere so that we can see a little

398
00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.300
 bit of the inside.

399
00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:24.400
Just make sure you haven't accidentally selected all the keyframes.

400
00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:28.700
Let's try to add the same curves to the keyframes by

401
00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:30.500
 clicking on the third slider button.

402
00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:34.600
It looks good. But while a complete

403
00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.600
 stop on the position looks more realistic, the same

404
00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.500
 doesn't apply for rotation. So we just need it

405
00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:41.200
 to slow down.

406
00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:45.300
For this we need to slightly lower the keyframes in the

407
00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:46.100
 speed graph.

408
00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:50.000
Or in case the animation was in the opposite direction raise

409
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.300
 it.

410
00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.700
You will notice that an issue appears as

411
00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:57.000
 both handles moves independently to avoid

412
00:21:56.300 --> 00:22:00.000
 this. We need to change the keyframe type

413
00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.400
 right click on the keyframe and

414
00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.200
 select keyframe velocity.

415
00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:08.500
Select the continuous checkbox, it will

416
00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:10.300
 link the position of the two handles.

417
00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.500
Now it will be easier for us to increase the speed a little

418
00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:15.200
 at this moment.

419
00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:19.700
Still the beginning seems too fast. I'll move

420
00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:22.000
 both the second keyframes by one frame.

421
00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:26.400
This way will make the start smoother and the jump

422
00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:29.300
 sharper. Let's move the other keyframe one frame as

423
00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:32.200
 well and make sure there is an elastic animation on

424
00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:33.400
 the rotation property.

425
00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:38.300
To see the expression animation on the graph. We need to expand the

426
00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:41.200
 expression interface and click on the graph icon.

427
00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:51.800
As you can see you can easily control this type

428
00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:54.700
 of object with effects. The most important thing is

429
00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:58.300
 to link all of the repeating parameters. However,

430
00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:00.700
 if you need to move the entire layer, it's

431
00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:02.800
 more convenient to create a new object.

432
00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:06.300
Play CD there in the center of the semi sphere or at

433
00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:09.500
 the base. I'll link the top layer to it. That's it.

434
00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:14.300
Let's see now another way of creating a

435
00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:14.900
 semi sphere.

436
00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:24.000
In order not to waste too much time on these two shapes. You'll

437
00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:27.000
 find that in composition 3 semisphere

438
00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:29.400
 2. I have already added anything. This is

439
00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:32.700
 a very simple and effective way to create a save the

440
00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:35.800
 3D Shape. We use two simple layers one

441
00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:38.400
 is a half circle and the second one is

442
00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:39.100
 an ellipse.

443
00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:44.700
The rotation of the semisphere is achieved by changing the

444
00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:47.400
 vertical size or scale of the

445
00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:50.600
 layer. It is suitable for achieving quick results, but

446
00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:53.300
 it has some limitations firstly we cannot make a

447
00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:56.300
 full rotation around the axis as easily as

448
00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:59.300
 we did with the CC sphere effect. We can only control

449
00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:02.100
 and animate it from one angle to see the same

450
00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:05.300
 sphere from the other side. We need to either duplicate the

451
00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:08.200
 ellipse and repaint it in the same color as the outside.

452
00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:10.900
But you live additional problem.

453
00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:14.600
Caused by transparent pixels or

454
00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:17.500
 if it's a shape layer create another ellipse inside

455
00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:21.000
 the half circle, but all of these adds complexity

456
00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:23.500
 to the animation as we need to additionally hide

457
00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.100
 and reveal different parts to see what we need.

458
00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:31.300
The second limitation is that we depend on the type

459
00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:34.300
 of layer as I mentioned in the first lesson. This means

460
00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:37.500
 that the color coordinates in the effect will remain

461
00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:39.900
 static and want to move with the layer.

462
00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:46.300
The first way to fix this is to add an expression

463
00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:49.200
 to each position property. This will

464
00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.600
 be to comp value.

465
00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:55.600
This is a special expression that converts effects coordinates into

466
00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.200
 layer coordinates in the composition. In other

467
00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:01.900
 words. This coordinates will now move with the layer. We

468
00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:05.000
 just need to return the color position to its

469
00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:05.700
 original place.

470
00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:11.800
The expression can be copied from the copy

471
00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:14.600
 expression on the menu and paste it into all

472
00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:15.300
 other properties.

473
00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:19.300
After adjusting the positions the colors will always

474
00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:20.500
 move with the layer.

475
00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.600
Another approach is to use a precomposed shape

476
00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:31.700
 layer or solid layer or even illustration

477
00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:34.900
 files from illustrator this like solid

478
00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:37.600
 or precomposed shape layers move effects along

479
00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:38.000
 with them.

480
00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:42.400
But be careful since this file should have high enough

481
00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:45.900
 resolution because when you start to deform them or simply

482
00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:49.400
 increase their scale, they will start to pixelate this

483
00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:52.100
 problem can be solved by turning on the continuous

484
00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:54.000
 right mode with this button.

485
00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:57.500
And then the file becomes a vector layer inside after

486
00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:57.800
 effects.

487
00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.500
Unfortunately, this will lead to the effects not moving

488
00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:05.100
 with the layer again. Yes. I know it's quite confusing, but

489
00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.600
 that's how After Effects works.

490
00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:10.800
Throughout the course, we will explore different situations and find

491
00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:13.600
 the best Solutions so that everything will

492
00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.700
 fall into place here. Our semisphere

493
00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:19.800
 is animated simply in one place. Therefore we

494
00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.800
 will have enough of this shape layers.

495
00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:25.700
Vector files will work with minimal deformations

496
00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:27.500
 and no noticeable pixels.

497
00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:34.400
Unfortunately, it's not possible to create a cube with an

498
00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:35.700
 effect like CC sphere.

499
00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:39.100
And making up pseudo Cube using 2D layers is

500
00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:42.900
 difficult. Therefore. We will create it manually using 3D

501
00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:45.400
 layers. The cube has only six sides

502
00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.000
 so it won't take too much time.

503
00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:51.000
For the sides of the cube, we can use solid layers

504
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.400
 instead of shape layers. This will make

505
00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:56.400
 it easier to add effects onto the sides of

506
00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:59.600
 the cube to make it more convenient. Let's place all of

507
00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:02.100
 the sides in a precomp. Let's create a

508
00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:05.400
 new composition. That's 500 by 500 pixels

509
00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:08.400
 and name it Cube inside it. Let's

510
00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.100
 create a solid layer with default settings.

511
00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:20.900
Let's enable the 3D mode and duplicate it five times. Let's

512
00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:23.500
 place a rotate all sides of the cube in

513
00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:24.800
 the respective positions.

514
00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:28.100
Let's switch to the camera view so we can

515
00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:29.600
 see it from the side.

516
00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:34.300
In the viewport window, we open the menu here and

517
00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:36.700
 change the active camera to custom View.

518
00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:41.300
If your angle is different go to the view menu and

519
00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:43.000
 select reset custom View.

520
00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:49.400
In alternative you can use the orbit around

521
00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:51.700
 to to rotate around the object.

522
00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:56.200
There were other new Option recently to the stool

523
00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:59.500
 that allow you to rotate not only around the object but also

524
00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:00.800
 around the center of the scene.

525
00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:04.700
This is really helpful next. We select

526
00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:07.400
 all the layers and open their position by pressing

527
00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:07.800
 p

528
00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:12.400
and the rotation Properties by pressing r

529
00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:16.300
To unfold both properties you need to press the r key

530
00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:17.700
 holding the shift key as well.

531
00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:22.300
We can even change the workspace to Vertical to get

532
00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:23.600
 a better view of all the layers.

533
00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:27.500
These actions may seem boring and monotonous. But

534
00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:30.400
 if you have any experience with 3D, you know,

535
00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:33.300
 this will be useful all sides should be

536
00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:35.000
 at the same distance from each other.

537
00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:39.800
Each side is 500 pixels and there are already in

538
00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:42.500
 the center of the composition. So we need to move then

539
00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:43.700
 by half of the length.

540
00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.500
Which is 250 pixels. Let's move

541
00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:50.800
 the first layer down by 250 pixels.

542
00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.300
 We can simply click on the property value and

543
00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:55.900
 write plus 250.

544
00:28:56.600 --> 00:29:01.000
After Effects, we'll do all the mathematical calculations automatically.

545
00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:02.100
 Let's move the

546
00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:05.700
 second layer up and subtract 250 pixels.

547
00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.900
Let's repeat the same with the rest of the sides.

548
00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:12.900
Afterwards, we just need to rotate all

549
00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:15.100
 of the sides accordingly to where they

550
00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:18.700
 are. Here. It is. It's already looking as it

551
00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:18.800
 should.

552
00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.900
However, all of the sites look the same.

553
00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:25.300
Let's change the color to our brighter one

554
00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:28.300
 or if you prefer you can always choose from the palette.

555
00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:41.700
In order to see the volume of the cube. Let's repaint two sides

556
00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:43.100
 of the cube in a darker color.

557
00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:47.400
We can take the same base color and make it darker.

558
00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.700
without losing any saturation

559
00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:53.800
Let's copy it to another side.

560
00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:01.000
Now we can go back to the main composition and place

561
00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.800
 the composition with the cube in it.

562
00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.200
To control a layer like a 3D cube. We need to do

563
00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:12.400
 two things first enable 3D mode.

564
00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:16.900
And then enable collapse transformation. This mode

565
00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:19.600
 turns the composition to a group and all layers

566
00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:22.200
 are now visible in this composition. They can

567
00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.900
 even be selected but nothing else can be done with them.

568
00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:28.100
Let's copy the animation on rotation from the

569
00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:31.300
 first sphere with the keyframes and the elastic animation

570
00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:31.600
 effect.

571
00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:44.300
Instead of full rotation we can make it a hard

572
00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:44.700
 rotation.

573
00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:50.000
This way we can have a better look at the size of the cube.

574
00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:00.700
Everything looks good. So now let's work on styling the

575
00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:01.000
 cube.

576
00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:07.000
The first thing I led is the inner Shadow, I'll

577
00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:09.700
 use it to brighten the edges of the cube will

578
00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:12.300
 make it white with an overlay blending mode.

579
00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:15.200
 We can also increase the distance and blur the Border.

580
00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:21.600
Let's turn it so that the light source is in the upper right

581
00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:21.800
 corner.

582
00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:26.400
We can increase the blur even more.

583
00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:30.900
So that there's a bit of light on the opposite sides. This

584
00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:33.300
 not only adds a slight plastic effect.

585
00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:36.400
 But also more depth this even reminds us of

586
00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:39.400
 the subsurface scattering that exist on skin

587
00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.300
 and some translucent materials.

588
00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:45.300
As in the previous lesson, we'll add even more depth by

589
00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:46.800
 adding another object inside.

590
00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:48.700
Let's duplicate the layer.

591
00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:53.100
Make both layer slightly transparent this time

592
00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:55.800
 increase the size of the first layer and

593
00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:59.100
 make the second layer a bit smaller that the

594
00:31:58.100 --> 00:31:59.400
 one on top.

595
00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:05.100
We should be able to see both layers through we'll blur

596
00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:07.800
 the bottom layer adding the fastbox puller

597
00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:07.900
 effect.

598
00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:12.200
And we'll blur just enough so that we can still see

599
00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:15.500
 a little bit of the internal boundaries of the cube for color

600
00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:18.300
 saturation change the blending mode of the top

601
00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:19.200
 layer to multiply.

602
00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:23.400
And to make the dark side a bit lighter we can add the

603
00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:26.100
 fill effect to this layer and fill it with the

604
00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:26.500
 same color.

605
00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:30.200
Just copy this effect from the layer inside.

606
00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:34.200
But keep it still a little bit darker we can we can

607
00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.100
 the entire effect.

608
00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:45.600
Expand the layer and inside the Field Effect reduce the

609
00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:45.900
 opacity.

610
00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.600
It looks great. We're done with the cube.

611
00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:00.100
Now, let's see how to turn any stroke into a

612
00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:01.000
 3D object.

613
00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.800
We can create a stroke into different ways.

614
00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:12.700
By using the pen tool we can create any arbitrary

615
00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:13.000
 shape.

616
00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:15.000
It can be opened or closed.

617
00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:25.300
Or we can create a basic shape and then convert it

618
00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:26.600
 to a better path.

619
00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.700
Turn off the field and turn on the stroke.

620
00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:33.500
If we turn this layers into a 3D layers and

621
00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:37.000
 try to rotate them, you will notice that the stroke remains

622
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.200
 flat.

623
00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:41.300
There are three popular tricks to make the stroke

624
00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:41.900
 volumetric.

625
00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:47.400
The first is to add stroke in the layer styles.

626
00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:54.000
To do this. The regular stroke will have to

627
00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:57.300
 be reduced to a minimum then we can rotate the

628
00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:00.400
 layer and it will look 3D from all sides

629
00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:04.600
 except from this angle where it completely disappears apparently

630
00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:06.700
 due to some peculiarities of

631
00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:09.300
 processing it. Also these stroke is

632
00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:12.600
 more difficult to stylize with other layer Styles in

633
00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:15.500
 terms of practicality. This tricks currently sits in

634
00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:18.000
 the last place for the second method. We want to

635
00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:21.900
 use layer Styles and instead use effects. Let's remove

636
00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:24.000
 the Styles and add a mask to the

637
00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:27.500
 layer for now. It can just be two points

638
00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:30.600
 anywhere after we link the past property

639
00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:33.400
 of the Mask to The Path property inside

640
00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:34.200
 the shape layer.

641
00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.300
Now we are the stroke effect.

642
00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:41.400
It adds a stroke to any selected mask on

643
00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:42.700
 the layer or all at once.

644
00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:50.400
You can change the color inside and it also has a built-in

645
00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:51.600
 trim path feature.

646
00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:58.400
The problem is that this is quite resource intense because

647
00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:01.400
 it creates a large amount of circles throughout the

648
00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:01.800
 path.

649
00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:05.700
To make the line look good. You need to minimize the spacing

650
00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:08.600
 property as much as possible and for

651
00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:11.000
 clarity. You need to increase the brush hardness.

652
00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:14.600
You can add the other layer effects and styles to

653
00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:15.100
 the stroke.

654
00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:23.100
All our style and techniques work here as well as the 3D

655
00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:23.500
 rotation.

656
00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:31.200
This technique ranks second as it is a bit more flexible. The

657
00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:33.300
 third technique is the most interesting to me,

658
00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:35.500
 but it requires using Scripts.

659
00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:37.300
But you already have them.

660
00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:40.600
Basically, the shape path is consisted by

661
00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:43.100
 any point and we can have access

662
00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:46.600
 to each of them as this points can be tied to another layer

663
00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:49.800
 and we can then move the layer in 3D space

664
00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:52.200
 to do this in your windows menu

665
00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:55.500
 go to the list of scripts and there you'll

666
00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:58.000
 find a preinstalled create news from path.

667
00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:02.700
To work with it. You need to select a path in in

668
00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:03.100
 the layer.

669
00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:07.200
The first function creates new layers where the points

670
00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:10.900
 are located. So the points are tied to them by moving

671
00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:14.100
 the new objects. We can control each point independently.

672
00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:18.500
The second function on the contrary links the null

673
00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:20.200
 layers to the position of points.

674
00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:25.700
For now, we'll only need the first function. The technique

675
00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:28.300
 here is to enable the 3D mode.

676
00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:29.800
In this node.

677
00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:34.500
while at the same time leaving the shape layer

678
00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:34.800
 into the

679
00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:38.200
it's better to turn off 3D to avoid bugs.

680
00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:42.200
Rotating such layers in 3D is useless. So we need

681
00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:45.400
 to create a new common null object place it

682
00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:49.000
 approximately in the center of the shape make it make

683
00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:51.400
 it 3D as well and Link the

684
00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:52.700
 other new layers to it.

685
00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:57.300
By rotating it. We rotate the entire object.

686
00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:01.300
It's also better to use stroke with rounded Corners

687
00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:04.400
 using round cap and round join.

688
00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:08.700
This way we can rotate it at any angle even in

689
00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:11.500
 the angles that the first two method school

690
00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:11.900
 and handle.

691
00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:16.700
But the coolest thing is that we can also move other new layers

692
00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:19.700
 in 3D and create a complex volumetric

693
00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:19.900
 shape.

694
00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:24.200
Effects in layer Styles will also work on this layers.

695
00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:30.600
The main limitation of this and of the other methods is that

696
00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:33.300
 it's still not entirely real 3D.

697
00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:37.900
Although all the points are in different position coordinates.

698
00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:40.100
 Our entire object is made out

699
00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:43.700
 of a 2d shape layer. This means we cannot

700
00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:46.200
 Place another object inside it even if

701
00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:49.400
 we do duplicate the structure no matter how much we rotate it.

702
00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:53.000
 The layer above will always be higher than the

703
00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:55.300
 other. Therefore. We will only be able to use

704
00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:58.500
 them in limited situations that are required interaction with

705
00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:01.900
 other layers. There are also two other constraints

706
00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:04.100
 you may encounter which are related to the

707
00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:07.400
 script itself and it's Expressions the linking worked

708
00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:10.600
 with a path drone with the pen tool because the

709
00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:13.300
 position of all the inner groups was set to

710
00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:13.700
 zero.

711
00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:17.600
You can see these as the Anchor Point and position

712
00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:19.700
 inside the shape are both at zero.

713
00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.900
Now, let's look at the rectangle layers when

714
00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:28.500
 we create this type of shapes and then

715
00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:30.200
 convert them to bassiere path.

716
00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:33.500
The position inside the shape is not zero.

717
00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:38.300
This means that when you try to link the position to zero and they

718
00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:39.600
 will be in a different place.

719
00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:43.400
To fix this you need to manually reset the

720
00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:46.900
 values after which everything will look normally to

721
00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:49.500
 make things easier for you. This problems have been

722
00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:51.100
 solved in motion tools Pro.

723
00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:57.700
This one also add new subjects

724
00:38:57.700 --> 00:38:59.800
 and links points to them.

725
00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:05.800
And if you try to link a layer and encounter the same problem holding

726
00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:08.400
 down the shift key will automatically reset the

727
00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:11.400
 position of the layer and the link in will work correctly.

728
00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:16.800
This resetting is not always reliable if there

729
00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:19.600
 are keys and expressions on the properties. So by

730
00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:22.100
 default the link is done without resetting.

731
00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:24.900
now on to the second issue

732
00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:29.200
when creating a shape Circle we have not only

733
00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:32.300
 points but also handles if we try to link the

734
00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:35.200
 points to zeros using the classic tool the shape will only appear

735
00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:38.100
 three dimensional until we start rotating it.

736
00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:47.400
The expressions of this tool do not take into account

737
00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:48.700
 the position of the handles.

738
00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:52.400
To solve this problem. You can find an advanced

739
00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:55.500
 version of the script on the web. But motion tools can

740
00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:58.400
 also handle this if there are handles on the path.

741
00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:01.500
 They will be added as new layers which will

742
00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:04.200
 be which will be linked to the main rule points.

743
00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:08.200
And everything will rotate correctly with this

744
00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:11.600
 techniques. You can create complex structures and have an

745
00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:14.400
 interesting visual style over the next few lessons. We

746
00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:17.700
 will try some more practical examples of

747
00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:20.500
 these shapes and animations for them. Now. Let's

748
00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:23.200
 move forward and discuss another shape.

749
00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:29.200
There are probably more ways to create cylinders that any other

750
00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:32.200
 primitive shapes this is because there is

751
00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:35.300
 no single best method and each one has its

752
00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:38.400
 own advantages and disadvantages. We won't

753
00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:41.100
 be using cylinders in this course, but the time you

754
00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:44.300
 useful for you to know some techniques in the cylinder composition.

755
00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:47.400
 You will see four cylinders. They all

756
00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:50.600
 look the same overall but each one was created differently.

757
00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:53.900
 The first thing there is Created from 3D

758
00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:56.400
 layers. The layers are arranged on the

759
00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:59.800
 sides just like we did with the cube, but the

760
00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:02.300
 fact that it looks solid is deceptive.

761
00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:05.400
There is a partition in the middle that creates volume

762
00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:08.500
 only from one angle the top and bottom

763
00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:11.400
 are made of two layers so that they can have

764
00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:14.800
 different colors under different angles. This

765
00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:17.200
 means they can only be slightly offsetting position

766
00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:20.400
 from one another but in our version we

767
00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:23.200
 use special expression that will help hide the

768
00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:26.600
 layer that's not facing us. So it automatically hides and

769
00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:29.500
 displays them without Distortion. We also

770
00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:33.300
 use a camera in the composition for good perspective without

771
00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:35.200
 it. You will notice problems on

772
00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:38.100
 the sides that are otherwise very difficult to hide.

773
00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:41.400
When you create such a camera from scratch, you

774
00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:44.700
 need to specify the maximum lens size or even

775
00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:45.900
 increase the focal length.

776
00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:51.700
The camera will automatically position itself so that

777
00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:54.900
 our object Remains the Same Size this works

778
00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:58.000
 to rotate the cylinder around the x-axis only.

779
00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:02.300
To rotate it around the y axis I needed to

780
00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:04.200
 add another expression so that the middle

781
00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:07.500
 layer will always stay in place and not rotate with

782
00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:08.300
 the other layers.

783
00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:13.300
In this type of cylinder is also easy to adjust

784
00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:16.900
 the height by simply animating the scale along the y axis

785
00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:17.700
 in the new object.

786
00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:21.400
Since the top and bottom are just ordinary circles.

787
00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:23.500
 We can change their color and gradient.

788
00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:27.400
If for instance we use solid layers instead

789
00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:29.700
 we can even add effects.

790
00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:33.300
But it will be more difficult to repaint the

791
00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:37.000
 middle and lower parts because they will be different layers.

792
00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:40.100
We could further style as our cylinder with

793
00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:43.500
 additional adjustment layers effects and blending modes.

794
00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:45.300
But here is another way.

795
00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:50.000
If you make a precomp of the entire cylinder, then you

796
00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:51.700
 can add styles to the layer.

797
00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:58.400
and you can change the tone and I just

798
00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:03.400
let's consider the second option. This option

799
00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:06.500
 is particularly difficult and we have prepared this

800
00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:09.500
 specifically for this course it consists of a

801
00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:12.900
 single shape layer created by using keyframes

802
00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:15.700
 and expressions the controls for the cylinder

803
00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:18.200
 are located in the effects. They allow

804
00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:20.300
 you to quickly adjust the width 8th.

805
00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:25.700
And one axis of rotation the other axis

806
00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:27.900
 is available within the layer itself.

807
00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:31.700
You can also add effects and layer size to this

808
00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:34.800
 layer. However, if you need to add different effects

809
00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:37.100
 to different parts, you need to follow the same

810
00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:40.700
 steps as we did with the same sphere duplicate

811
00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:43.900
 the layer keep only the necessary then link

812
00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:46.500
 the duplicated parameters and proceed

813
00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:48.300
 to style each individual part.

814
00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:52.700
Since these are ordinary shapes and not 3D

815
00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:55.700
 layers. We don't need any additional cameras. Now. Let's

816
00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:58.500
 have a look at the third option here. You

817
00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:01.400
 will see only one shape layer and one camera.

818
00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:04.400
 It is fully 3D and you can rotate the object

819
00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:07.400
 without any limitation on all axis. But in

820
00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:10.400
 order to do this, I switched the rendering engine to

821
00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:13.500
 Cinema 4D now in shape layers, we have

822
00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:16.900
 additional groups of geometry and material settings.

823
00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:20.400
In them you can easily control the hate of the

824
00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:23.700
 object, but unfortunately, that's about all you

825
00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:26.500
 can easily do with this renderer layer blending

826
00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:29.200
 modes and layer Styles don't work. There are

827
00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:32.400
 also lots of difficulties with gradients in the

828
00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:35.700
 new shape options. We can only add one color and other material

829
00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:38.400
 settings for each side of

830
00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:39.100
 the cylinder.

831
00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:43.400
And an important ones is that to add this shape options

832
00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:46.300
 the shape must be in a group. Otherwise, you will

833
00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:50.000
 get an error material settings will be familiar from

834
00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:51.700
 the CC sphere effect.

835
00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:55.200
You can try to play with the styling options

836
00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:58.300
 by analogy if you add a new layer source to the composition.

837
00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:06.200
Also our styling works if you

838
00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:07.200
 make a pre comp.

839
00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:10.700
So just in case make sure that classic 3D

840
00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:12.500
 works in the new composition.

841
00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:16.700
Then you can add regular effects

842
00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:18.300
 and styles to this layer.

843
00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:22.400
In contrast to the first option the camera in this composition is

844
00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:25.300
 also optional and you will see any issues

845
00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:28.600
 of on the borders because it is real 3D.

846
00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:32.600
One more advantage to this method is that you can complicate

847
00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:35.800
 the shapes of the cylinder with the help of other shapes, but

848
00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:38.700
 we won't be using this method in the course as

849
00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:41.500
 it significantly reduces the performance

850
00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:43.900
 and complicates working with the project.

851
00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:48.700
Let's consider the last option for creating a

852
00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:49.000
 cylinder.

853
00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:52.300
This time it's a 3D composition.

854
00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:56.400
Classic 3D is used here. And it looks like a

855
00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:58.900
 real cylinder in Cinema 4D mode.

856
00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:02.400
But actually it's just an imitation and it consists

857
00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:03.400
 of multiple layers.

858
00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:07.500
These are just ordinary circles placed at equal

859
00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:10.200
 distance from each other. There are just so many

860
00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:13.200
 of them that they emerge into a solid figure.

861
00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:15.700
This is where the drawbacks lie.

862
00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:19.200
If it's rotated at a certain angle, no matter how

863
00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:20.500
 dense the layers are.

864
00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:24.600
You will notice a distortion. So this angle should always

865
00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:25.400
 be avoided.

866
00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:30.800
This layers can be placed manually or automatically

867
00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:33.300
 using Expressions. Thanks to the use of

868
00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:36.100
 Expressions. We have moved some parameters to the

869
00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:37.300
 composition layer itself.

870
00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:41.700
These include the cylinder hate layer position and

871
00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:42.500
 color settings.

872
00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:47.400
Since these are since this is a 3D object. We can

873
00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:51.000
 also control its shape using the layer scale at the

874
00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:53.300
 same time because everything is inside the one

875
00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:56.700
 composition. It may be difficult adding more complex gradients to

876
00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:58.000
 different parts of the cylinder.

877
00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:03.300
But since this is a regular classic 3D layer,

878
00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:05.700
 we can add Styles and effects to it.

879
00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:09.400
The main thing that we can forget is that

880
00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:12.300
 in order to rotate this layer. We have to enable

881
00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:15.400
 collapse transformation. This means that

882
00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:18.400
 the effect will no longer move along with the layer

883
00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:21.500
 to make up for this you'll need to add special expressions.

884
00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:25.600
As we did in the second version of the semisphere and that's

885
00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:25.700
 it.

886
00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:29.600
These are all the options you can try to create each one

887
00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:32.600
 yourself or use the ready-made presets

888
00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:35.500
 for your animations, but you need to experiment and

889
00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:38.400
 think about how you can visually stylize the object using

890
00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:40.300
 the techniques. We already went through.

891
00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:48.700
That's all for today. We covered a lot of topics while creating

892
00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:51.200
 all these shapes. You may need some time to

893
00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:55.000
 try them all out and find the strength and weaknesses of

894
00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:57.100
 which Approach at the same time. You can

895
00:47:57.100 --> 00:48:00.600
 also figure out your optimal way of stylizing each

896
00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:03.400
 object. Even though 3D is not the

897
00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:07.300
 main use for After Effects. It can give us good opportunities. It

898
00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:09.800
 can give us good opportunities to experiment with

899
00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:12.700
 different layer Styles and animation

900
00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:15.800
 tools moving forward. We'll learn even

901
00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:18.700
 more complexity interesting techniques through exercises

902
00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:21.500
 focusing not only in motion, but also

903
00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:25.100
 on how to combine all of this approach into more

904
00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:27.100
 intricate and advanced animations
